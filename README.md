# Self-Healing Kubernetes System With Predictive Monitoring

Welcome to the **Self-Healing Kubernetes System With Predictive Monitoring**!  
This project aims to enhance the resilience and reliability of Kubernetes clusters through predictive analytics and automated self-healing mechanisms.

## 🚀 Overview

Kubernetes is powerful but complex, and failures can still occur even with built-in high availability. This project introduces an intelligent monitoring and remediation layer that:

- **Monitors cluster health and workloads** in real-time using advanced metrics collection.
- **Predicts potential outages or performance degradation** by leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning techniques.
- **Automatically triggers healing workflows**, such as restarting pods, scaling workloads, or reconfiguring resources before outages impact users.

## 🧠 Features

- **Predictive Monitoring:** Uses historical and real-time data to anticipate failures before they happen.
- **Automated Remediation:** Initiates corrective actions automatically (e.g., restarting, rescheduling, or scaling pods).
- **Integration with Kubernetes:** Seamlessly integrates with your cluster without disruption.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Modular components for monitoring, analysis, and remediation to suit various environments.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
- **Prometheus & Grafana** (or similar) for real-time metrics and dashboarding.
- **Python / Go** or your chosen language for custom monitoring and ML pipelines.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) for predictive analytics.

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/areysid/Self-Healing-Kubernetes-System-With-Predictive-Monitoring.git
   ```

2. **Deploy the monitoring stack** to your Kubernetes cluster (see `/deploy` or installation docs).

3. **Configure predictive models and self-healing rules** as per your requirements.

4. **Monitor your cluster and watch the magic happen!**
